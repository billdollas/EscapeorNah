## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.


My game is basically an escape room. It will consist of 3 levels, which are displayed as 3 rooms. In the first room it'll be the smallest room of them all and in this room you will have a set time of 30s to find the hidden key in the room. If the time runs out you lose. If you happen to find the key you move on to the next room which will be slightly bigger than the first room. Only in this room there will be 3 keys that has to be found also keys will randomize position and fade in and out, so the player will be able to see the keys sometimes giving them some type of hope/same for the 3rd room. Also besides the keys I want to have time icons that will increase the current time thats on the timer by 5 secs to give more time to find the keys. In the last room, there will be 6keys to find it is the biggest of all rooms and the plot twist is that there will never be a winner, I want only 5 keys to be found and the 6th key to never appear but the time increments will continue to pop up, leaving the player on a ongoing search for the sixth key. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

## Wireframes

Include images of your wireframes. 

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

## Game Components

### Landing Page
What will a player see when they start your game?
My landing page will consist of the option to pick avatar, either male or female. Then after that is chosen you will be able to click the play button. Not sure if I want the play button to appear when the avatar has been chosen.

### Game Initialization
What will a player see when the game is started? 
When the game in started the player will see a small square, with an avatar at the top left corner.


### Playing The Game
What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expeted to do and what will the user expect from the game.

The flow of the game is basically the user using the up, down, left, right keys to move around in the 'rooms'. The first room you wont be able to see the key because it is hidden, so the avatar will basically have to explore, so the user will be utilizing the up, down, left, right keys in order to find or come across the key. The key will unlock the next level, in the next level the keys are randomizing and fading in and out, there will also be a time icon that increments time to the time clock that will always begin at 30s.

### Winning The Game
What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?

WELLLLL muahahaha! When time runs out you will lose, there will be no set winner because the ;ast key in the last room wont be found, but time will be able to be increased, to give hope to the player that the key can still be found.

### Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

There will be a restart button that leads to the beginning of the game (landing page) where you have to choose your avatar.

## MVP 

Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP 


## POST MVP

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP
## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Logic | H | 10hrs|  |  |
| CSS | Mid | 8hrs|  |  |
| JavaScript | H | 24hrs|  |  |
| Pseudocode | Mid | 4hrs| 12hrs |  |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs |  |
| Total |  | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  

## jQuery Discoveries
 Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
